Some utility functions for automatic processing of sign orthographies and transcription methods will be added here.

Currently there are some basic functions for using HamNoSys. The functions in hamnosys_conversion.py can convert between HamNoSys unicode symbols and there IDs (i.e. hamfist, hamfinger, etc)

You can also access the deployed web app for SALT here: https://signlanguagetranscription.github.io/
The mobile apps are available on Google Play for Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learn_sign_transcription) and the AppStore for iOS (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sign-language-transcription/id6738986793)
