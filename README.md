Some utility functions for automatic processing of sign orthographies and transcription methods will be added here.

Currently there are some basic functions for using HamNoSys. The functions in hamnosys_conversion.py can convert between HamNoSys unicode symbols and there IDs (i.e. hamfist, hamfinger, etc)

You can also access the deployed web app for SALT here: https://signlanguagetranscription.github.io/
It is still in development. More features are planned to be presented at SIGN10.
